Still little bit things to do with this d&amp;d 5e monster thing
This is made with ionic. Nodejs combo

You may need to get familiar with js/ionic/angular if you plan to use this. 

There might be some mistakes here and there.

This is working version of older js project. Currently making new one, as time permits.
